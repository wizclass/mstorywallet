				1. INFORMATION ABOUT US
				<br>
				1.1. We operate the Site PinnacleMining.net and our contact is support@pinnaclemining.net.
				<br>
				<br>
				2. OUR SERVICES
				<br>
				2.1. Mining Hardware, Services, and Packages. Bitcoin mining hardware (“Mining Hardware”) consists of specialized
				computing hardware, computer programs, networking interconnectivity and associated facilities that run proprietary
				Bitcoin mining software (“Software”). We are selling you the specific volume of processing power (the 'Service' or
				'Services') of that Mining Hardware corresponding to an amount of processing power (measured in billions of Bitcoin
				calculations per second or “Gigahashes”) specified in each order for probable, but not guaranteed, opportunity to
				earn. We rent all Mining Hardware to provide Services to you and our other users (“Users”) and which we also use
				ourselves for our own account.
				<br>
				<br>
				2.2. Mining Contracts.
				<br>
				a. When you enter this Agreement to offer us the right to provide you Service, and we accept your offer by sending
				you an order confirmation (an “Order Confirmation”), a contract (a “Mining Contract”) to provide Service is formed.
				Upon commencement of Service, we will allocate a part of Mining Hardware equal to a certain amount of Bitcoin
				mining computer computational power (“Mining Contract Capacity”) to you for your use in mining Bitcoins.
				<br>
				b. The types of Mining Contracts potentially available at any time are described in detail at PinnacleMining.net.
				You must have purchased a Mining Contract to have any right to use Services to obtain any right to Product (defined
				below).
				<br>
				<br>
				2.3. Rental of Mining Hardware. We provide Services to you and our other Users, including customers who have
				current and valid Mining Contracts and also to use ourselves for our own account. You acknowledge that by executing
				this Agreement and reserving a Mining Contract, and by logging into our Site and accessing your account, you are
				undertaking Bitcoin mining on your behalf only, at your own risk and for your own benefit. In allocating to you the
				Mining Contract Capacity, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Mining Hardware on your
				behalf, partially on behalf of our other Users, and partially on behalf of ourselves. We retain for our own benefit
				the portion of the total Mining Hardware not allocated through Mining Contracts.
				<br>
				<br>
				2.4. Mining Product. The Mining Hardware will mine Bitcoins by utilizing Hashing Power. The Bitcoins produced by
				the Mining Hardware (the “Product”) will be centrally collected by us, and we will distribute a portion of the
				Product to Users (“Customer Portion”) based upon the Mining Package allocated under valid Mining Contracts held by
				Users during the period of effectiveness of your Mining Contract (the “Term”), with such distributions subject to
				Maintenance Fees.
				<br>
				<br>
				2.5. Distribution of Product Portions. Customer Portions will be distributed to your Bitcoin Credit Wallet (defined
				below).
				<br>
				<br>
				2.6. Service Fee. The fee that you pay for the Mining Contract, as described on the website.
				<br>
				<br>
				2.7. Maintenance fees. A fee that we may charge you daily from your Customer Portion to cover running costs of
				Mining Hardware, as described on the website. The fee will be converted to the number of Bitcoins based on the
				previous day's Bitcoin closing price in US$ in the Bitcoin Price Index published on Blockchain.info.
				PinnacleMining.com can change the maintenance fee any time with 7 days' notice.
				<br>
				<br>
				2.8. Termination. Any particular Mining Package Contract shall be terminated after 1000 days and all contracts will
				be terminated when mining is no longer profitable.
				<br>
				<br>
				3. YOUR ACCOUNT
				<br>
				3.1. Password. As part of the process of selecting and paying for a Services, you are required to create an account
				on the Site (“Account”) and to provide your email (“User Name”) and password (“Password”). To protect your Account
				and to prevent unauthorized access to it, keep your Password confidential. You are responsible for any activity
				that happens on or through your Account. If you become aware of or suspect any unauthorized use of your Password or
				Account, please change your Password immediately and notify us immediately. If we believe that there has been
				unauthorized access to your Account, we reserve the unilateral right to suspend or discontinue any and all
				Services, your Account, in which event we will endeavor to notify you.
				<br>
				<br>
				3.2. Bitcoin Wallet. Your “Bitcoin Wallet” is the Bitcoin address that you provide to us from time to time for the
				payment to you of your Customer Portions. You have no ownership interest in any Bitcoin held by us. We do not
				operate your Bitcoin Wallet. By entering the Bitcoin wallet address you acknowledge the ownership of it. You are
				solely responsible for maintaining and controlling your Bitcoin Wallet. Be sure to safeguard the access credentials
				to your Bitcoin Wallet. Any Product is only as secure as your confidential access credentials. If you forget or
				misplace your access credentials to your Bitcoin Wallet or if others gain access to your Bitcoin Wallet, with or
				without your authorization, you could permanently lose your Bitcoins, including any Customer Portions we transfer
				to your Bitcoin Wallet. To be clear, we have no liability for any operation or failure of your Bitcoin Wallet.

				<br>
				<br>

				the case, the provisions of this Agreement that limit our liability or disclaim warranties also apply to our
				Suppliers.
				<br>
				<br>
				12.3. Your Service Fee is at Risk, and There Is No Guarantee That the Service Will Produce Product. The fact that

				or from the Service, in the future. You should view your entire Service Fee as being at risk as you enter this

				<br>
				<br>
				IN USING OUR SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE CONDUCTED SUFFICIENT DUE DILIGENCE TO UNDERSTAND
				THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH BITCOIN MINING. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR PROVISION OF CONSTANT HASH-RATE UNDER YOUR MINING
				CONTRACT, YOUR MINING CONTRACT MAY NOT RESULT IN THE CONSTANT GENERATION OF NEW BITCOIN DUE TO OTHER FACTORS,
				INCLUDING THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL NETWORK HASH-RATE, THE INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY COSTS, THE DECREASE IN PRICE

				our inability to perform is the result of an Event Outside Our Control.
				<br>
				<br>
				12.5. Other Disclaimers of Liability. Except as otherwise provided by nonwaivable, nondisclaimable applicable Law
				or the express provisions of this Agreement, we will not be liable for any losses or damages caused by (a) your

				TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE AND THE OTHER ENTITIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
				EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY WARRANTY OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THERE IS NO WARRANTY, WHETHER BY US
				OR THE OTHER ENTITIES, THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT YOUR ACCESS TO THE SAME WILL BE
				UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR WITH RESPECT TO
				PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, SECURITY CAPABILITY, CURRENTNESS OR OTHERWISE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION
				OR ADVICE GIVEN BY ANY PERSON SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER RELATING TO US OR THE OTHER ENTITIES,
				AS APPLICABLE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE OR THE OTHER ENTITIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE
				SERVICE OR YOUR ACCOUNT.
				<br>
				<br>
				UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE OR THE OTHER ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL,
				PUNITIVE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GAIN, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF YOUR INFORMATION,
				AND THE LIKE), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR
				RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MARKETING OR PURCHASE OF THE SERVICE OR ANY USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR
				YOUR ACCOUNT, EVEN IF WE OR THE OTHER ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
				<br>
				<br>
				BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL
				DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT IN A PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE ANY DISCLAIMER
				OR LIMITATION ON DAMAGES OR LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN IS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THEN WE AND THE OTHER
				ENTITIES WILL BE ENTITLED TO THE MAXIMUM DISCLAIMERS OR LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES AND LIABILITY AVAILABLE AT LAW OR IN

				15. HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES ABOUT THE SERVICES?
				<br>
				15.1. General. YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ARISING UNDER, CONCERNING, OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
				(INCLUDING ANY SERVICES), ITS INTERPRETATION, ITS VALIDITY (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM THAT ALL OR ANY PART OF THIS

				Dispute and your requested resolution. In order to discuss the Dispute with you, you permit us (or the Disputed
				party) to contact you by phone, text message, email or physical mail through any and all addresses or phone numbers
				that you have provided. You must send us notice of any Dispute within 30 days of your discovering the act or
				omission that gave rise to your Dispute. If you do not so notify us, then you lose your right to raise the Dispute.
				<br>
				<br>
				15.4. Resolution Offer. Within the first 30 days of your submitting your Dispute, we will have the right, but no
				obligation, to provide you with a proposed resolution of the Dispute (the “Offer”). If you are unsatisfied with the
				Offer, you must reject the Offer by notice to us within 14 days of the Offer. If you do not reject the Offer within
				at 14-day period, you will be deemed to have accepted it and forfeit your right to raise the Dispute. If we do not
				make the Offer within 30 days of your submitting your Dispute or if you reject an Offer as set forth above, either
				you or we may commence arbitration of the Dispute as set forth below.
				<br>
				<br>
				15.5. Place and Language. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in the English language, in the US. We
				shall choose the arbitration service to be used for the Dispute.
				<br>
				<br>
				15.6. Award. Any award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the award. Judgment
				upon an award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitrator must be
				based upon this Agreement and applicable Law. The decision of the arbitrator is final and binding except for fraud,
				misconduct, or errors of law, and judgment upon the decision rendered may be entered in any court having
				jurisdiction.
				<br>
				<br>
				15.7. Waiver of Rights
				<br>

				IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE. IT PROVIDES THAT YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO SETTLE ANY CLAIM OR
				DISPUTE THROUGH ARBITRATION, EVEN IF YOU WOULD PREFER TO LITIGATE THE CLAIM IN COURT. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHTS
				YOU MIGHT HAVE TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS BEFORE A JURY, TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION
				OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THE
				ARBITRATOR'S AWARD, MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION OR MAY BE MORE LIMITED. YOU SHOULD CONSULT LEGAL COUNSEL TO
				DETERMINE WHETHER THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU.
				<br>
				<br>
				YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT
				TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY, TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY (EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN THE
				ARBITRATION RULES), AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. IN ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE IS
				RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN
				COURT PROCEDURES. YOU ALSO AGREE ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE LIMITED TO THE DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY AND
				WILL NOT BE PART OF A CLASS-WIDE OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.
				<br>
				<br>
				15.8. NO CLASS ACTIONS. EVEN IF APPLICABLE LAW, OR THE ARBITRATOR OTHERWISE PERMITS CLASS ACTIONS OR CLASS
				ARBITRATIONS, THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE SPECIFIED HERE APPLIES AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON
				A CLASSWIDE BASIS – THAT IS – TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A
				CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.
				<br>
				<br>
				16. OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS
				16.1. Governing Law. English laws will govern any disputes relating to the Service or these Terms, notwithstanding
				the English conflicts of laws rules or any other jurisdiction.
				<br>
				<br>
				16.2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including any Services) constitutes the entire agreement between you and
				us. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement, promise or representation made or given by or on
				behalf of us which is not set out in this Agreement.
				<br>
				<br>
				16.3. Our Assignment. We may transfer or assign our rights and obligations under this Agreement or a Service to
				another entity, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under this Agreement or the terms of the
				Service. We will endeavor to notify you in writing if this happens.
				<br>
				<br>
				16.4. Your Assignment. A Service is between you and us, and you may not assign, transfer, sublease, encumber or
				subject to any security interest a Service without written authorization from us. Any attempted assignment in
				violation of this Agreement will be void and of no effect.
				<br>
				<br>
				16.5. Third Party Beneficiaries. No other person, other than you, shall have any rights to enforce this Agreement
				or a Service, whether under the Contracts or otherwise.
				<br>
				<br>
				16.6. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, including without
				limitation anything regarding the arbitration process, such provision will be struck from this Agreement only to
				the extent it is invalid or unenforceable. Unless otherwise provided, all other terms of this Agreement will remain
				in full force and effect.
				<br>
				<br>
				16.7. Waiver. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Agreement, or if we do not
				enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights
				against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by
				you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by
				you.
				<br>
				<br>
				16.8. Conflict. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and something stated by any Other Entity, whether
				before or after you enter into this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will prevail.
				<br>
				<br>
				16.9. Survival. Any terms of this Agreement which by their nature should survive will survive the termination of
				this Agreement.
